Rashtchy reasons that the stock has fallen so quickly due to these long-term concerns about the overall market and that as a leader on the Internet, the shares will rebound quicker when the market begins to improve. ""While we don't know if the market is growing to show any signs of improvement any time soon, we do expect Yahoo to have positive announcements in the next few weeks leading to its earnings release Oct. 10th,"" he writes.

The firm said the issue ""still has some appeal as a value stock"" but added that it has little confidence in its own ability to predict earnings for Circuit City because of the company's ongoing remodeling initiatives. Jefferies explained the reaction to the second-quarter figures was extreme because there was ""considerable buzz"" suggesting that the same-store sales figures ""would not really be that bad."" Coventry Health CV.H, +0.00% lost 9 percent after Prudential Securities lowered its rating on the company's stock to ""sell"" from ""hold."" The firm also cut Humana HUM, +5.49% similarly, while upgrading the HMO industry in general, and Trigon TGH, -2.06% WellPoint WLP and HealthNet HNT, +0.00% specifically. All three companies received upgrades to ""buy"" from ""sell"" based on their ""strong underwriting positions and lower relative valuations."" Coventry and Humana were cut for precisely the same reasons, namely Prudential's determination that the companies have higher relative valuations and higher underwriting risk.

Coventry shares closed down $1.80 at $18.90. Dobson Communications DCEL sank 20 percent after Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Jeff Hines lowered his rating on the Oklahoma City wireless phone services firm to ""market perform"" from ""strong buy,"" to reflect the increased risk and uncertainty that shareholder face given the controlling shareholder's pledge of 53.6 million shares as collateral for a $290 million loan. Dobson shares jumped in early action Friday after the company hired Banc of America and Lehman Bros. to assist in exploring its strategic options. But after rising as high as $17.19, the stock sold off and closed down more than 5 percent at $14.08. ""Now does not seem to be an appropriate time to be looking to maximize value for shareholders via a sale of Telecom assets,"" Hines said in a note to clients. ""Given the current state of the market and apparent financial health of the controlling shareholder, one cannot see how Dobson is in a position of strength in any such negotiations.""

PolyMedica PLMD edged down 22 cents to $12.78 after the company reaffirmed its revenue outlook of $68 million to $69 million for the second quarter ending September 30, and $275 million for fiscal 2002. The Woburn, Mass., medical device firm said its core business remains strong with ""increased demand for diabetes and respiratory supplies from a growing base of loyal customers."" However, PolyMedica said it would not be able to provide an earnings outlook due to its expectations that it will incur ""unusual legal and related expenses in the current quarter"" estimated at 10 to 14 cents per share from the federal investigation of its Liberty Medical Supply and Liberty Home Pharmacy units. In addition, PolyMedica said it has received administrative overpayment notices from a durable medical equipment regional carrier, or DMERC. The company said it expects to expense $800,000 to $1 million related to the notices in the current quarter. Noting that it uses the same pricing formula for albuterol and ipratropium with three other DMERCs, PolyMedica said it could expense up to an additional $5 million to $5.5 million if these companies were to take the same position. Roadhouse Grill GRLL plunged 56 percent after it re-opened for the first time since August 1 when the company announced it would have to restate prior financial results due to accounting errors. On August 15, the Pompano Beach, Fla., casual dining firm reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results, and noted that its auditors had issued an opinion that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern in light of its ""significant cash flow problems, the net loss for fiscal 2001 and defaults under certain of the company's loan facilities, covenants, and payment provisions."" Shares were off 75 cents at 60 cents. ScottishPower SPI, -0.12% sank 9 percent after the company said that the recent collapse in electricity prices in the western U.S. would result in additional excess net power costs of roughly $300 million at its PacifiCorp operations.

The company added that management is working to mitigate risk and improve processes and that PacifiCorp plans to seek regulatory recovery of allowable excess net power costs. Shares closed down $2.35 at $25.45. Steel Dynamics STLD, -0.93% tumbled 8 percent after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lowered its rating on shares of the Fort Wayne, Ind., firm to ""neutral"" from ""outperform"" due to disappointing pricing trends. ""2001 price increases have failed and gains should be modest in 2002, we anticipate,"" the firm said in a research note to clients. ""We believe that it may take all of 2002 and perhaps part of 2003 for the industry to secure the price increases that are currently in the marketplace."" The firm also lowered earnings estimates on the company for 2001 through 2003. USX X, -1.56% which Morgan already rates ""neutral,"" had its estimates cut by the firm for the same reasons. Steel Dynamics was off $1.19 at $12.90. USX ended down 93 cents, or 5 percent at $17.00. Tellium TELM, +0.00% dove $1.82, or 21 percent to $17.00. Harry Carr, the chairman and CEO for the Oceanport, N.J., optical switching technology firm, attributed the selling to news that one of its customers, Qwest, plans to curtail capital spending. He told CBS MarketWatch this concern was unwarranted. ""We spoke to Qwest today and based on the conversation, we're confident that going forward we are going to be one of the company's supplier in both the near-term and the long-term."" Saying that business is ""great"" at Tellium, Carr also reaffirmed the company's confidence in its goal for revenue of $125 million to $135 million in 2001, which it disclosed when it reported second-quarter results on July 18. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call are looking for a loss of 16 cents a share in the September quarter Tellium went public on May 17, offering 9 million shares at $15 each in its well-received debut.

The Dow Jones Industrial Averagesprinted 171.58 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,932.33. The barometer was up 75 points just before the Fed's 2:15 p.m. ET announcement. The Nasdaq Composite skipped up 73.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,293.07 for its 11th record close in 13 days. The Standard & Poor's 500 Indexrose 1.8 percent, for its first record close in four months. The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks gained 0.9 percent. Market Snapshot Market Pulse Movers & Shakers Earnings Surprises Fed hikes rates WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- The Federal Reserve raised overnight interest rates by a quarter-percentage point Tuesday, bringing the Federal funds rate to 5.5 percent and the discount rate to 5 percent. With the rate hike, its third this year, the central bank thus removes the last of the extra liquidity it added to the money supply a year ago, when conditions in financial markets seemed so bleak as a panic swept the globe. The increase of 25 basis points will be matched almost immediately in the prime rate banks charge and eventually will be reflected in most other market interest rates, from corporate borrowing to mortgage rates.

Making clear it won't be thrown so easily, Vodafone also unfurled a list of reasons as to why a marriage with Mannesmann makes sense on Tuesday. Among other things, the two would ""have an unmatched European footprint,"" Vodafone said. It also said the combined companies would chalk up at least $820 million (500 million pounds) in savings in 2003 and $972 million (600 million pounds) in 2004. On Sunday, Mannesmann rejected a $106 billion unsolicited acquisition bid from Vodafone AirTouch, the world's biggest cellular-phone operator.

Full story Around the Web Morningstar does a good-cop-bad-cop job on foreign-stock-fund managers Tuesday, lauding them for, on average, beating the growth of the S&P 500 this year while chiding them for expense ratios that are higher than the average in any domestic-fund category. Gregg Wolper of the fund-tracking firm says managers should work to cut their costs to ensure that their funds stay as attractive to investors as they are currently and ""solidify their position in the marketplace."" He concedes that fund firms will trot out the excuses that travel costs are high and that it's costlier to unearth data on firms located abroad than in the United States. But Wolper argues that cut-rate airfares are available to anyone who bothers to shop and adds that other research costs have also come down. As proof, he notes that TIAA-CREF, T.

Wynn's pioneering company, builder of the classy Mirage and Bellagio casinos in Las Vegas, has suffered several Wall Street downgrades. The company's spending on a Treasure Island upgrade in Vegas -- and heavy marketing spending at the new Beau Rivage casino in Mississippi -- is slimming Mirage Resorts profits even as revenue climbs smartly. Thom Calandra's StockWatch Economic convergence for China, U.S. SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) --After 13 years of talks, a deal has finally been struck under which the United States will support China's membership in the World Trade Organization. It represents a triumph of pragmatism over ideology, a process which began decades ago when Nixon and Kissinger decided to initiate a dialogue with that Communist power. Since then, the key objective for our developing relationship has been economic convergence, based on the theory that the coming together of our economic systems will inevitably lead to the necessary reforms of their political and legal systems -- that capitalism will lead to democracy and the rule of law. Paul Erdman Lock in insurance rates now WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Have you thought about investing in term life insurance but haven't gotten around to it? Better act now, because rates for many of these policies will probably go up in January. Why?

OBAS,"PHILADELPHIA (Inman) -- Have you been shopping around for a home loan lately? Mortgage professor Jack Guttentag says you may have been fooled by advertised APR rates and and how effective they are for comparing mortgage prices. How useful are APR rates for loan shopping? ""In trying to compare mortgage prices of different lenders, I understand that I have to look at the fees as well as the points that lenders charge, but ads in the newspaper only show rate, points and APR. If I remember correctly, you said that the APR includes all lender fees, but you also warned consumers not to use the APR. Why aren't lenders required to show all their fees in their ads rather than just the points?"" Your question points up one of the critical failures of mandatory disclosure rules in the home loan market. Borrowers are overwhelmed with information they often don't understand, such as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), and critically important information that they would understand is nowhere to be found. Aside from the interest rate, the single most important piece of information to a borrower is the total up-front credit charge -- the total that the borrower must pay the lender and mortgage broker for the loan. Yet lenders are not required to disclose it in either the Truth in Lending Statement (TIL) mandated by the Federal Reserve, nor the Good Faith Estimate of Settlement (GFE) required by HUD. Why's this? The Federal Reserve requires lenders to report the APR, which is a comprehensive measure of credit cost that takes account of the rate and most up-front credit charges. No doubt the Fed reasoned that since the borrower knew the APR, the figure for total credit charges that is used in calculating the APR was redundant. But it is not redundant, because many borrowers who would understand the figure for credit charges do not understand the APR, and are therefore reluctant to use it. APR assumptions There is good reason for borrowers to be leery of the APR, even if they do understand it. The APR assumes the borrower will be in the house for the entire term of the loan, which most are not. Borrowers who don't expect to have their mortgage for 10 years or more can easily be led astray by the APR. In an earlier column that is now on my Web site -- Does the APR Help? -- I give some concrete illustrations of this. If your time horizon is shorter than 10 years, it is more useful to know the credit charges used to calculate the APR than to know the APR itself. Using a calculator that I developed with Charles Freedenberg of DecisionAide Analytics, you can convert the one into the other. The APR fee calculator works backwards from the interest rate, points and APR on fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to derive the other up-front fees that were used by the lender to calculate the APR. How it works My local newspaper on September 20 quoted one lender as offering a 30-year FRM at 7.75 percent and 1 point, with an APR of 8.66 percent. Using a $100,000 loan amount. I entered these four items in the calculator, clicked on the ""compute"" button, and it told me that lender fees other than points amounted to $7,180. Note that APRs shown in the media assume a loan amount of $100,000 unless the loan is designated ""jumbo,"" in which case the assumed loan amount is $250,000. The fees derived from the calculator using APRs shown in the media do not include all settlement costs. Mortgage insurance is not included in the APR until a borrower has been identified who requires it. Settlement costs that are not viewed as part of the cost of credit also are not included. These items include settlement/closing fees, abstract/ title search/title examination/title insurance costs, recording/filing fees, and city/county/state taxes. The APR calculator assumes that lenders have properly identified all the charges that should be included in the APR, and have calculated the APR correctly. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that these assumptions are not always correct. Since mistakes will usually be in the direction of understating the APR, the user should place more credence in high charges -- such as the one cited above -- than in low ones.","Nov 16, 1999 11:30 a.m. ET",1,Real Estate: What a lender's APR doesn't tell you,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/real-estate-what-a-lenders-apr-doesnt-tell-you

OBAS,"HERZLIYA, Israel, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Optibase Ltd. OBAS, +0.00% today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Revenues from fixed income real estate totaled $4.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to revenues of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss attributable to Optibase Ltd shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $518,000 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of $1.6 million or $0.31 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues totaled $16.6 million, compared with $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss attributable to Optibase Ltd. Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.1 million or $0.22 per share, compared to a net income of $195,000 or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were approximately 5.2 million and 5.1 million basic and diluted shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.3 million, and shareholders' equity of $77.1 million, compared with $16 million, and $74.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Amir Philips, Chief Executive Officer of Optibase commented on the fourth quarter results: ""We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance maintaining stability, mostly in our fixed income real estate rent and operating income. Our yearly results are showing a net loss that is attributed mainly to equity share in losses of associates related to the investment in 300 River Holdings, LLC, which beneficially owns the rights to a 23-story Class A office building located at 300 South Riverside Plaza in Chicago, IL. While our NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 increase to $13.5 million and by 2.7% over the same period in 2016, our recurring FFO decreased to $4 million and by 13.4% over the same period in 2016. The decrease in recurring FFO is primarily due to equity share in losses of associates related to the investment in 300 River Holdings, LLC. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our NOI increase to $3.4 million and our Recurring FFO increased to $1.9 million."" Mr. Philips concluded: ""We will continue our work to maintain our basic parameters as we progress through 2018."" ACCOUNTING AND OTHER DISCLOSURES Non-GAAP Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income, which, to calculate NOI, is adjusted to add back real estate depreciation, and amortization, general and administrative expenses and other operation expenses less gain on sale of operating properties. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe that NOI (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense item that are incurred at the property level. We consider the NOI to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, to understand the core property operations prior to depreciation and amortization expenses and general and administrative costs. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, we consider the NOI to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets. The metric NOI should only be considered as supplemental to the metric operating income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. NOI should also not be used as a supplement to, or substitute for, cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States). Non-GAAP Funds from operation, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income, which, to calculate FFO, is adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated associates. We make certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Non-GAAP recurring FFO or recurring FFO, to account for items we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, including transaction costs associated with acquisitions. We use FFO internally as a performance measure and we believe FFO (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) is a useful, supplemental measure of our operating performance as it's a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry. We also believe that Recurring FFO is a useful, supplemental measure of our core operating performance. The company believes that financial analysts, investors and shareholders are better served by the presentation of operating results generated from its FFO and Recurring FFO measures. We consider the FFO and Recurring FFO to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, in analyzing our operating performance. The metric's FFO and Recurring FFO should only be considered as supplemental to the metric net income as a measure of our performance. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, (ii) is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions, (iii) is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and (iv) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance.

In addition, for the third quarter of 2017, our Recurring FFO decreased to $955,000 compared to $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2016.

For more information, please refer to our 6K reports filed with the SEC on November 24, 2017 and November 28, 2017 respectively.""

The Company's revenue numbers beat analysts' estimates by $14.05 million. For Q2 2017, Leju's cost of revenues was $19.2 million, reflecting an increase of 31% from $14.6 million for Q2 2016, primarily due to the increased cost of advertising resources purchased, partially offset by decreased staffing cost of the editorial department as a result of headcount change. The Company's selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $117.9 million for the reported quarter, down 12% from $134.3 million for the year-earlier same quarter, primarily due to decreased marketing expenses related to the Company's ecommerce business and decreased commission expenses in-line with the decrease of revenues. During Q2 2017, Leju recorded goodwill impairment charge of $41.2 million. The Company stated that since changes in market environment continued to have a negative impact on its operating conditions and business outlook, an impairment loss of goodwill of $41.2 million was recognized based on the impairment assessment review. Leju's loss from operations was $83.0 million for Q2 2017 compared to income from operations of $10.1 million for Q2 2016. The Company's non-GAAP loss from operations was $37.4 million compared to non-GAAP income from operations of $16.5 million for the prior year's same quarter. For Q2 2017, net loss attributable to Leju's shareholders was $87.3 million, or $0.64 loss per diluted ADS, compared to net income attributable to Leju's shareholders of $9.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted ADS, for Q2 2016. The Company's non-GAAP net loss attributable to Leju's shareholders was $42.3 million, or $0.31 loss per diluted ADS, in the reported quarter compared to non-GAAP net income attributable to Leju's shareholders of $15.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted ADS, for the year-earlier same quarter. ""During the second quarter, we continued to face an extremely challenging operating environment,"" said Mr. Geoffrey He, Leju's Chief Executive Officer, ""Restrictive policies on the real estate industry such as price ceilings, required holdings period, and tightened mortgage lending were strictly enforced in this quarter and further expanded from tier 1 and tier 2 cities into some lower-tier cities. As a result, demand for marketing activities was sharply reduced in both primary and secondary real estate markets in major cities where we operate, which had a significant and negative impact on our operations and results."" Leju's Segment Results Revenues from ecommerce services totaled $63.7 million for Q2 2017, a decrease of 46% from $118.2 million for Q2 2016, primarily due to decreases in both the number of discount coupons redeemed and in the average price per discount coupon. During Q2 2017, the Company generated revenues from online advertising services of $24.8 million, a decrease of 28% from $34.4 million for Q2 2016, primarily due to a decrease in property developers' online advertising demand. The Company's revenues from listing services totaled $4.2 million, a decrease of 26% from $5.7 million for the prior year's same quarter, primarily due to a decrease in secondary home sales. Cash Matters As of June 30, 2017, Leju's cash and cash equivalents balance was $192.5 million. The Company's reported quarter net cash used in operating activities was $29.5 million, mainly attributable to non-GAAP net loss of $42.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued marketing and advertising expenses and other current liabilities of $13.2 million. Business Outlook For Q3 2017, Leju is forecasting total revenues in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million, which would represent a decrease of approximately 48% to 54% from the $183.3 million reported in Q3 2016. Stock Performance On Friday, September 22, 2017, the stock closed the trading session flat at $1.75. A total volume of 14.07 thousand shares have exchanged hands. Leju's stock price advanced 7.36% in the last one month. The stock currently has a market cap of $237.62 million.

OBAS,"HERZLIYA, Israel, August 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Optibase Ltd. OBAS, +0.00% today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. Revenues from fixed income real estate totaled $4.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to revenues of $4.2 million for the second quarter of 2016. Net loss attributable to Optibase Ltd shareholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was $35,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $933,000 or $0.18 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, revenues totaled $8.2 million, Net loss attributable to Optibase Ltd Shareholders for the period was $550,000 or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $1.7 million or $0.32 per basic and diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation for the periods were approximately 5.2 million basic and diluted shares for each period. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $18 million, and shareholders' equity of $77 million, compared with $16 million, and $74.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Amir Philips, Chief Executive Officer of Optibase commented on the second quarter results ""This quarter results are stable compared to the second quarter of 2016 in our fixed income real estate rent and operating income, while our net income has decreased mostly in Other income and Equity share in income (losses) of associates, net. For the second quarter of 2017 we generated NOI of $3.3 million representing a slight decrease compared to the same period in 2016. In addition, for the second quarter of 2017, our Recurring FFO decreased to $806,000 compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in our Recurring FFO is due to a decrease in our Equity share in income (losses) of associates, net, related to our investment in 300 River Holdings, LLC and a decrease in Other income from our investment in Texas."" Mr. Philips concluded: ""We will continue to work to maintain our operating results and to increase our financial stability."" ACCOUNTING AND OTHER DISCLOSURES Non-GAAP Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income, which, to calculate NOI, is adjusted to add back real estate depreciation, and amortization, general and administrative expenses and other operation expenses less gain on sale of operating properties. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe that NOI (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense item that are incurred at the property level. We consider the NOI to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, to understand the core property operations prior to depreciation and amortization expenses and general and administrative costs. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, we consider the NOI to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets. The metric NOI should only be considered as supplemental to the metric operating income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. NOI should also not be used as a supplement to, or substitute for, cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States). Non-GAAP Funds from operation, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income, which, to calculate FFO, is adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated associates. We make certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Non-GAAP recurring FFO or recurring FFO, to account for items we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, including transaction costs associated with acquisitions. We use FFO internally as a performance measure and we believe FFO (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) is a useful, supplemental measure of our operating performance as it's a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry. We also believe that Recurring FFO is a useful, supplemental measure of our core operating performance. The company believes that financial analysts, investors and shareholders are better served by the presentation of operating results generated from its FFO and Recurring FFO measures. We consider the FFO and Recurring FFO to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, in analyzing our operating performance. The metric's FFO and Recurring FFO should only be considered as supplemental to the metric net income as a measure of our performance. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, (ii) is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions, (iii) is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and (iv) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance.
